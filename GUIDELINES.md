# Get Paid to Write Tutorials

We're calling all developers, system administrators and technical writers: get paid to share your knowledge and earn **50 € per tutorial** for each unique and well-written tutorial. These tutorials will be featured in our [tutorials section](https://www.alwyzon.com/tutorials) and we will credit any author with their name next to the article (plus, an optional link to their personal blog or website). Additionally, all contributors also qualify for free goodies and vouchers for our services, such as free virtual servers.

Articles can be written on wide variety of topics, but should focus on topics related to hosting and virtual servers. Articles can cover how-to guides, conceptual overviews for some cool and new technology, or simply troubleshooting references for common mistakes.

If you are interested in becoming a contributor, please **drop us a mail at <tutorials@alwyzon.net>**. Please do not just send a prepared article to this email address, as we would prefer to pick a topic together with you to avoid duplicated content. Another tutorial on an already well-covered topic will not help anybody!

## Guidelines

All articles should be submitted as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) files to our Github repository [alwyzon/tutorials](https://github.com/alwyzon/tutorials). Please use our template as a basis for your work and try to match the writing style and strucutre of the existing tutorials on our website.

**Dos:**

- test all tutorials on a fresh server before submitting them,
- compose your article in a way that any technically-averse user can follow it—even if he doesn't have a background in that specific top, and
- proofread your work before submitting!

**Don'ts:**

- do not plagiarize content—all articles must be unique, original and your work, and
- do not repost them on other websites.
